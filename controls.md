# Project Ghost Grid - Controls and Gameplay Guide

Welcome to Project Ghost Grid! This guide will help you understand how to control your character and interact with the game world.

## 1. Movement Controls

Your character moves on an invisible grid, but the movement feels fluid and responsive.

### Keyboard Input (Recommended for Desktop/Web)

*   **Cardinal Directions:**
    *   **W** or **↑ (Up Arrow):** Move Up
    *   **S** or **↓ (Down Arrow):** Move Down
    *   **A** or **← (Left Arrow):** Move Left
    *   **D** or **→ (Right Arrow):** Move Right

*   **Diagonal Directions:** Combine cardinal keys for diagonal movement.
    *   **W + A** or **↑ + ←:** Move Up-Left
    *   **W + D** or **↑ + →:** Move Up-Right
    *   **S + A** or **↓ + ←:** Move Down-Left
    *   **S + D** or **↓ + →:** Move Down-Right

### On-Screen Buttons (Recommended for Mobile/Touch)

At the bottom of the screen, you'll find a 3x3 grid of buttons:

*   The outer 8 buttons correspond to the 8 directions of movement (Up, Down, Left, Right, and all diagonals).
*   Simply tap the desired direction button to move one step in that direction.

## 2. Ability Usage

Your character has powerful abilities to defeat enemies. Abilities are used in a two-step process: **Activate** and **Target**.

### Activating Abilities

*   **Keyboard Hotkeys:**
    *   **1:** Activate **Fireball**
    *   **2:** Activate **Sword Slash**

*   **On-Screen Buttons:**
    *   Tap the **"Fireball"** button.
    *   Tap the **"Sword Slash"** button.

### Targeting Abilities

Once an ability is activated, you enter **Targeting Mode**:

1.  A yellow circular decal will appear on the game grid, indicating the ability's area of effect (AoE).
2.  **Tap anywhere on the game grid** to move this decal to your desired target location.
3.  The ability will automatically fire at the decal's position as soon as you tap, consuming the ability and applying its effects.
4.  To exit Targeting Mode without firing, tap the **"Cancel"** button.

### Action Buffering

If you try to use an ability on a target that is currently out of range, the game will **buffer** that action. As you move your character closer, the buffered ability will automatically fire as soon as the target comes within range. This allows for fluid combat planning.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Characters:**
    *   **Blue Square (P):** Your player character. Health is displayed inside.
    *   **Red Square (E):** Enemy character. Health is displayed inside.
*   **Projectiles:** When you or an enemy use a ranged ability (like Fireball), you will see an orange circular projectile fly across the screen. Damage is applied when the projectile reaches its destination.
*   **AI:** Enemies will chase your character and attack when they get within range of their abilities.
*   **Game Area:** The outlined grey box represents the playable grid area. Characters cannot move outside this boundary.

Good luck, and have fun in Project Ghost Grid!
